Overview

This project focuses on the removal of anomalies from images and display them on the output. Anomalies can often be unwanted elements like random noise, dust, or artifacts that degrade image quality and affect subsequent processing or analysis tasks. By employing various techniques and filters, this project aims to enhance image clarity by effectively eliminating such anomalies.
Features

    Anomaly Detection: The project provides algorithms to detect and identify anomalies in images.

    Anomaly Removal: Utilizes filters and algorithms to remove detected anomalies from images, improving overall quality.

Technologies Used

    Python: The primary programming language for implementing the image processing algorithms.

    OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library): Used for loading, processing, and analyzing images.

    Matplotlib: Utilized for visualizing images and results during the development and testing phase.
